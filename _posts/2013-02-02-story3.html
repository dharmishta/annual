            <p>Everyday governments gather massive amounts of data, about everything from building safety to restaurant cleanliness. </p>
            <p>In 2013 Code for America made restaurant inspection readily available to diners &mdash; by putting it on Yelp.  We collaborated with staff from government and Yelp to create a standardized format for restaurant inspection data, called LIVES. Now any city that releases their restaurant inspection data in this standardized way can easily integrate it into Yelp, and have it displayed on restaurant profile pages. Currently, four cities have done this: Louisville, San Francisco, x, and x. </p>
            <p>These cities are no only giving residents the information they need to keep themselves and their families healthy &mdash; but hopefully inspiring restaurants everywhere to keep their kitchen's clean.</p>
            <p>When governments make data available to the public it builds trust, when they showcase the data in a location that the public can easily find &mdash; instead of hiding it away in the bowels of a government website &mdash; it fortifies the community.</p>
