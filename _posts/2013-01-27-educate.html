      <h3>WE ARE COLLABORATING</h3>
      <p>Local governments are changing. Forward-thinking citizens and public servants across the country
      are leveraging technology to change the way our cities work &mdash; and it’s accelerated by an exchange
      of ideas, solutions, best practices, and even software code between like-minded leaders. 
      <br><br>In 2013 we led this conversation through our programs, annual conference, educational content,
      and collaborative tech projects. We exposed city officials to ideas like lean thinking and
      user-centered design &mdash; and watched them take it back and change the way they do their jobs.
      Cities are now appointing Chief Data Officers and creating innovation offices; they're redeploying each
      other’s apps; and they're working together to take on common policy challenges. Through the end of 2013, 
      our work has directly led to the creation of 13 new innovation positions inside city halls and 30 new rules
      or policies to support innovation.</p>

          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>One of Code for America’s most important measures of success is the extent to which we create capacity
          for innovation inside government. We’ve seen a dramatic pick up of our fellowship model across the country
          and around the world. The White House’s Presidential Innovation Fellowship program was inspired by CfA,
          and our founder, Jen Pahlka, is currently serving in the White House as the United States Deputy CTO 
          for Government Innovation. Our international partners launched Fellowships in Mexico City and Jamaica,
          and the City of San Francisco now has both Mayor’s Innovation Fellows and Entrepreneurs-in-Residence.

          <h4>Supporting New Skills</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Code for America offers city employees trainings and resources to build modern government skill sets. 
          Supported by CfA workshops, webinars, guides, and one-on-one support, governments are learning user experience design,
          data­-driven policy making, and lean startup techniques. And by showcasing on a national stage what’s
          working in individual cities, we’re helping to establish the new standards for civic innovation.</P>

          <h4>Evangelizing and Advancing Open Data</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>
          Governments gather massive amounts of valuable data. But data is only useful when it's made available
          to the public, and integrated with the apps and websites people already use everyday. This year, Code
          for America walked cities through the process of passing an open data policy, deployed open data portals,
          and led the collaborative creation of three new civic data standards. Chicago’s former Chief Data Officer,
          Brett Goldstein, and CfA's Lauren Dyson co-edited Beyond Transparency, a book showcasing experts who have
          used open public data to solve problems.
