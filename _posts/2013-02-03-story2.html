              <p>The City of Oakland receives a huge volume of public records requests, but their existing request system
              created duplicate work and made it difficult to track
              outstanding inquiries &mdash; and it was confusing for users. The City's employees strove to respond
              promptly, but they struggled with the quantity of requests and the tool
              that they used to fulfill them. As a result, tensions arose between residents and the City over request
              compliance.</p><br>
              <p>The 2013 Fellows interviewed employees in every City department, from the Fire Department to IT,
              as well as residents and community groups, before building 
              <a href="http://records.oaklandnet.com">RecordTrac</a> to streamline this records request
              process. It offers three key services: a searchable archive of past requests and responses, a simple
              form to make a new request, and a tool to track the status of a request. Over 2,000 requests had been
                made through the new tool by year's end.
              </p><br>
              <p>By bringing transparency to the system, saving city staff time, and improving responses, RecordTrac
              is repairing the relationship between residents and City Hall around transparency and public
              information.</p>
