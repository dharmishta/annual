            <p>The systems created to help our most vulnerable neighbors don't always operate as well as they could. That's why in 2013, two local government Human Services Agencies (HSA)&mdash;San Francisco and San Mateo County&mdash;partnered with CfA to improve service delivery.</p>
            <p>Working with the San Mateo County HSA, Fellows created SMC-Connect, an app that asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" Replacing an out-of-date and inaccessible paper booklet, the app offers relevant, accurate, and easy-to-access information about local service providers. Built as a platform, the solution allows services providers to update their own information and invites the creation of other apps.</p>
            <p>In San Francisco, the Fellows learned that too often residents loose their food assistance benefits, not because they no longer qualify, but because the City's communication in about benefits was slow, full of legalese and confusing. To help ease the problem, the team built Promptly, an SMS notification system to alert clients their benefits were at risk, making San Francisco HSA the first City agency to text their clients. Since launch, already half of the users were able to keep eating.</p>
